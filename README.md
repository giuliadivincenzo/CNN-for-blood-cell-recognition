# Convolutional Neural Network for blood cell recognition
This project was developed for the course of Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning during my MSc. in Mathematical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano, A.Y. 2024/2025.
The aim of the project was to develop a CNN model to correctly classify blood cell images.
# Description
[Grad_CAM_training_tutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/giuliadivincenzo/CNN-for-blood-cell-recognition/blob/main/Grad_CAM_training_tutorial.ipynb): underline which parts of the images mostly unfluenced the classification.
[Architecture_Comparison.ipynb](https://github.com/giuliadivincenzo/CNN-for-blood-cell-recognition/blob/main/Architecture_Comparison.ipynb): comparison between different architectures in order to determine which performs better.
[Optimizers_Comparison.ipynb](https://github.com/giuliadivincenzo/CNN-for-blood-cell-recognition/blob/main/Optimizers_Comparison.ipynb): comparison between different optimizers in order to determine which performs better.
[buil-train-test.ipynb](https://github.com/giuliadivincenzo/CNN-for-blood-cell-recognition/blob/main/build-train-test.ipynb): final model which performs training and fine-tuning.

This project was done in a group of four.
