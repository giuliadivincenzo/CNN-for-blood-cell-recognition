# Convolutional Neural Network for blood cell recognition
This project was developed for the course of Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning during my MSc. in Mathematical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano, A.Y. 2024/2025.
The aim of the porject was to develop a CNN model to correctly classify blood cell images.
